#Class structure in Java
A *class* in Java is defined by the class keyword. Class are a blueprint, or a set of instructions 
to build a specific type of object. 
It is a basic concept of Object-Oriented Programming which revolve around the real-life entities. 
Class in Java determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain.
All classes in Java must be in a package, we can name the package or else our class will be in the default package.
