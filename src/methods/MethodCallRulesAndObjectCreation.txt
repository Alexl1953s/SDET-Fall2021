2 types of methods: Static and non static

- Static -> members[methods and variables] belong to a class
- Non static -> members[methods and variables] belong to an object

-- Static methods can be called from both static and non static methods directly
without creating an object of the class;

-- Non static methods can only be called from static methods by creating an object of the class;
-- Non static methods can call other non static methods directly;

How do we create an object?

public class MyClass {

    public static void main(String [] args) {

        MyClass myObject = new MyClass(); -> this is how we create an object of any class
        // class name then give any name to your object and = sign followed by new and class name
    }
}
