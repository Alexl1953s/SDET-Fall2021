2 types of methods: Static and non static

- Static -> members belong to a class
- Non static -> members belong to an object

-- Static methods can be called from both static and non static methods directly
without creating an object of the class;

-- Non static methods can only be called from static methods by creating an object of the class;
-- Non static methods can call other non static methods directly;
